Usage
--------

**I made one**

Click on the Thingiverse button and if not already logged in, enter your Thingiverse user data and accept our app.
Afterwards a window is created where you can use either the visicam or the camera of your computer to take a photo of your created thing. On the left side is a live preview of how the picture will look like, on the right side is a textfield to enter a description. By clicking on the "pubish" button the taken photo and its description is uploaded automatically to Facebook.
